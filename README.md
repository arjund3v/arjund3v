### 🖥️ I’m a first year computer science student
- I am an 19 year old Canadian student studying computer science, I have always been intruiged by computers, and did a lot of scripting for discord bots, game scripts, and 3D modelling! I am always looking for opportunities to learn, my life practically revolves around technology nowadays.

### ✏️ I’m currently learning C++, JavaScript, and SQL
- I am in the process of learning C++, JS, and Oracle SQL. I plan to extend my knowledge on these technologies and create projects based on these technologies in the near future

### 📜 I love to learn, and plan on expanding my knowledge on multiple technologies this year
- I will be learning React.js and other JavaScript frameworks. I hope to have a portfolio website built by April 2023
